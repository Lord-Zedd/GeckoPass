# GeckoPass
Password Creator For The Original Gex


Another small project because I was always inspired by Bisqwit's password videos. Supports all the ports of Gex that were released; PSX, PSX PAL, Saturn, PC, and even the released PSX Prototype that uses longer passwords.

This tool allows you to decode existing passwords or create your own, or even port passwords between versions.

The PSX Prototype is an odd case I wanted to point out due to the password system still being in development, the game doesn't appear to write the same format as it reads, and there is an extra 8 bits that seem to go unused after running through the entire game.
